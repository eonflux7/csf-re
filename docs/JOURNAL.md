Dated findings, newest last. Keep entries short; put conclusions into PLAN.md.

## 2026-10-07 — Phase 0 symbol harvest

- PS2 prototype (TLES-52768, 2005-02-28): `TLES_527.68` and `COMMX_FR.ELF` are stripped loaders. Game code is in
  Metrowerks `MWo3` overlays `FINAL.BIN` (SP) and `FIN_RED.BIN` (MP, links Quazal NetZ). No symbols; a few assert
  file names (AudioDriverGeneric.cpp, Image.cpp, Quad.cpp, GfxLine.cpp, StlAllocator.h).
- PS2 retail (2006-03): `LOADER.00` has a symtab + .mdebug but it's a generic loader/newlib. `ENG.00` stripped.
  `FINAL.BIN`/`FINXX.BIN`/`FIN_RED.BIN` overlays again.
- Xbox retail: `eng.xbe`/`rus.xbe`/`default.xbe_orig` (game), `Default.xbe` is a CDX launcher. Strings give
  `c:\CommX\Src\Main\_out\Xbox-XBox Final\CommX_Final.exe`, PDB name `CommXPC.pdb`, ~100 .cpp names. No PDB.
  Extracted with extract-xiso (built in `work/tools/`).
- **Conclusion: no symbols anywhere.**

## 2026-10-07 — PC exe fingerprint and triage

- MSVC 7.1 (Rich: VC7.1 3077 / 4035 builds), linker 7.10, timestamp 2006-02-23. Sections: .text, _rwcseg,
  .rdata, .data, _rwdseg, .rsrc. Not packed.
- RTTI: only type_info/exception/std::logic_error family → game compiled with /GR-.
- FLIRT (auto) recognized only 524 CRT functions.
- Function alignment splits the binary: game, RW and NetZ are 16-byte aligned; D3DX9 (0x5a1d51–0x61de63) and the
  CRT are unaligned (prebuilt MS libs).
- `RwEngineInstance` = 0x8b68c0 (202 refs in RW D3D9 driver range); its users locate RW core (0x566000–0x5a1d50),
  RW D3D9 driver (0x61e0c0–0x646000) and RW toolkits (0x7c4000+ / 0x7d8000+).
- Draft totals: game ~14k funcs / 2.2 MB; rw 2.8k / 668 KB; netz 4.1k / 545 KB; d3dx9 1.2k / 481 KB.
  Game→lib boundary: ~470 RW, ~400 NetZ (inflated by misclassified ranges), 61 CRT.
- Leaked RenderWare SDK source exists on GitHub; deliberately not used (licensing taint). librw instead.
